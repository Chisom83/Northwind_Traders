I was responsible for designing and building a database from the provided dataset, then querying it to extract meaningful insights. Using SQL and Power BI, I explored key business metrics, answered crital business questions and developed an interactive dashboard.

The goal was to uncover growth opportunities, improve operational efficiency and support data-deriven decision making.
